### 1. Orient the board

<Chessboard>
  <CircleMarker slot="a8" />
  <CircleMarker slot="h1" />
</Chessboard>

Both players should have a light square on the bottom right corner on their side. This makes it so the queen is always placed on it's own colored square.

<Callout title="Note:">

Two common terms you will encounter regarding the chess board are _ranks_ and _files_. These simply reference the rows and columns on the chessboard respectively.

</Callout>

### 2. Place the pawns

<Chessboard fen="8/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/8 w - - 0 1" />

White pawns go across the _2nd rank_ and black pawns across the _7th rank_.

### 3. Place the rooks

<Chessboard fen="r6r/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/R6R w - - 0 1" />

Rooks go on the corners of the board on their respective sides.

### 4. Place the knights and bishops

<Chessboard fen="rnb2bnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNB2BNR w - - 0 1" />

The knight and bishop are what's known as _minor pieces_. The knights go next to the rooks and the bishops the square after.

### 5. Place the king and queen

<Chessboard fen="start" />

The queen is always placed on a square of it's own color. The king slots into the last remaining square.
