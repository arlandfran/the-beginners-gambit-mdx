## Castling

Castling is a special move that involves the king and a rook.

There are two directions to castle in:

**Kingside castling** (castling short) consists of moving the king from **E1** to **G1**, and the rook from **H1** to **F1**.

**Queenside castling** (castling long) consists of moving the king from **E1** to **C1**, and the rook from **A1** to **D1**.

<Castling />

There are several conditions for a player to be able to castle:

- The king and rook involved in castling have not previously moved.
- There are no pieces between your king and rook.
- The king is not in check.
- The king doesn't move through any squares that would put in check after castling nor move through a square attacked by an enemy piece. The rook however can move through or end up in a square being attacked.

<Chessboard

  arrows={[{ from: "b5", to: "f1" }]}
/>

_In the above example the king cannot castle as the F1 square is attacked by the black bishop._

## En Passant

En Passant _(in passing)_ is a special pawn capture that occurs when a pawn has advanced two squares and ends up next to an enemy pawn. When this occurs, the enemy pawn can capture the pawn that had moved, capturing “in passing”.

<EnPassant />

_The black D7 pawn moving forward two squares on its first move allows the white E5 pawn to capture it through the "en passant" rule._

## Promotion

When a pawn reaches the 8th rank (or the 1st rank for black), it is promoted to a queen, rook, knight or bishop at the players choice. Pawn promotion can also be a capturing move.

<Promotion />

Keep in mind that the choice is not limited to previously captured pieces, so if you promote another pawn, you can have multiple queens on the board.
