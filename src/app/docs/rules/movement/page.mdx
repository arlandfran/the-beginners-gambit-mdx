## Things to remember

- Pieces cannot move onto squares occupied by their own pieces.
- Pieces cannot jump over other pieces. The only exceptions are <Link href="/docs/rules/movement#knight">knights</Link> & <Link href="/docs/rules/special-moves#castling">castling</Link>.
- Pieces can move into vacant squares or squares occupied by opponent pieces by capturing them.
- If a piece is captured it is permanently removed from the game.
- The **King** is the only piece that cannot be captured. It can only be put in check and you cannot make any moves that would purposely put the king in check.
