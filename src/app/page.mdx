This site is designed as a **reference guide** to players that are brand new to Chess, and has a focus on visual learning aids as opposed to the heavy verbose articles you might usually find elsewhere on the web.

However due to the complexity of the game, illustrations alone are not sufficient enough to explain some of the key concepts so there will be long-form text here and there.

We hope you enjoy learning this beautiful game and most importantly have fun.
